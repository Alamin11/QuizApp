# QuizApp:
# In this app I just tried to make some interactivity with basic widgets widget 
# Callback function
Functions that we don't want to execute immediately rather a later time (Like on pressing a button) 
We need to call that without parenthesis

#Visible and invisible widgets
The widgets that we can see on the screen like text, button etc are visible widgets here. On the other hand widgets that are not visible on the screen but are very important to structer the other widgets on the app screen , most of them are layout widgets like row, column, container, stack etc .
